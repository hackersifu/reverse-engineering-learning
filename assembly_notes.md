# Notes
- Machine code versus assmembly code
    - Machine code is the binary representation of a program that the CPU can execute directly.
    - Assembly code is a human-readable representation of machine code, using mnemonics and symbols to represent instructions and data.
    - Shellcode is a small piece of code used as the payload in the exploitation of a software vulnerability. It is typically written in assembly language and is designed to be injected into a target process to execute arbitrary commands or gain control over the system.
